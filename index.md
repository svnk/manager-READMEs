This is a list of managers READMEs (like a projects README, but for working with managers; see Matt Newkirk's [article](https://matthewnewkirk.com/2017/09/20/share-your-manager-readme/) for a clearer explanation). 
The origin is a bit sketchy. The earliest one so far is from [Luc Levesque](http://luclevesque.com/post/15881999207/how-to-help-new-employees-be-rockstars-a-new-approach#!prettyPhoto) from 2012. Most of the current wave are inspired by the [README of Roy Rappaport](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TPSwdqDqVfWG9anfiOjGUjk0k6zQDij5xPvatPg7NFE/edit#slide=id.g3086af6854_0_57). 

Without further ado, here is the (alphabetically ordered) list of READMEs:
